    <p>Thinking of making a lasting memory with the folks <s>before they croak</s>? Then you are in the right place! This is the site that provides timeless information about taking your parents on a Disneyland vacation.</p>
    <p>The following information will help you avoid common <em>pitfalls</em> and <strong>traps</strong> on your journey.</p>

      <h3>Parents <strong>WILL </strong>Get Wet</h3>
      <p>A number of rides in the park have water as a main feature. Riders will get wet! This makes parents very nervous, but if you plan properly, you can make these watery rides enjoyable. Plan to get a fast pass for these rides so that you can come back in the sunny, hot afternoon and skip the long stand-by line. The warm sun will dry your clothes in no time. And if your parent really hates getting wet, bring a disposable poncho. They are cheap, lightweight, and packable.</p>
    </aside>

    <p>For a day of magic and fun, follow this order:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Eat an early breakfast.</li>
      <li>Head to the park 30 minutes before the gates open.</li>
      <li>Beat the lines and head to your favorite ride first.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>And if you have time, fit some of these into your day:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Churros</li>
      <li>Corn Dogs</li>
      <li>Coffee . . . <em>Lots</em> of Coffee</li>
    </ul>
